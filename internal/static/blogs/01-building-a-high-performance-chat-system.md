# Building a (kinda) high performance chat application with Python & Golang

## Context

On my junior year, I need to work on a project as a preparation course for the graduation thesis. At that time I had done a couple school projects, got a bit of experience on building a system, working with API and UI but just in general at most.

![me writing the 15th inventory management app for another school project](https://i.imgflip.com/92ecuk.jpg)

*Phone shop inventory, book shop inventory, flower shop inventory, ... what else?*

For this project, I feel like I want to do something more technical, mainly building something that will:

- Process & provide interaction in real-time
- Focus on the performance side (basically want to make it run fast)
- Give me an excuse to use new tech stack & toolkit

I was really inspired from [this blog from Discord](https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-stores-billions-of-messages), and I was able to borrow some spare PC hardware from my classmate (I'm a self-hoster, cloud is scary :D). So I decided to build a chat app. Basically a Discord clone. Yeah.
