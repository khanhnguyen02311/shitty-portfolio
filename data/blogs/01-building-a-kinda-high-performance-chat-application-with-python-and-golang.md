## Context

On my junior year, I need to work on a project as a preparation course before working on the graduation thesis. At that time I had done a couple school projects / big assignments, got a bit of experience on how to build a system, working with API and UI interfaces, but just for general, well known use cases at most. There were some fun & exciting projects too, but not too much.

For this project, I feel like I want to tackle something more technical, mainly trying to work on something that will:

- Process & provide interaction in real-time
- Focus on the performance side (basically want to make it run fast)
- Give me an excuse to use new tech stack & toolkit

Phone shop inventory, book shop inventory, flower shop inventory, ... what else?

I was really inspired from [this blog from Discord](https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-stores-billions-of-messages), and I was able to borrow some spare PC hardware from my classmate (I'm a self-hoster, cloud is scary). So I decided to build a chat app. **Basically a Discord clone.** Yeah.
